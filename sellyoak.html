          <td class="menuleft"><p>Well, it looks like I'm nearing the end of my 
              role as journal keeper. If F wants to keep this going that's great, 
              but the surprise news is that she'll probably be leaving the hospital 
              next week! She's going back to her parents for an overnight stay 
              this weekend, and if all goes well they'll throw her out on Wednesday 
              or Thursday (that's the hospital not her parents). Please don't 
              call this weekend though, let's leave it up to Faith initially to 
              contact people, as there's quite a lot to deal with coming home. 
              This is all quite a bit sooner than expected, but F can hobble up 
              and down a flight of stairs, her wounds have healed and there are 
              no respiratory problems, so they want her coping with day to day 
              life again, away from the protection of hospital.</p>

            <p>F will probably stay at her parents for a couple of weeks or more, 
              and when she's unblocked her mobile phone (blame me - I was sure 
              I knew what the pin was, but sadly I was a year out) will be in 
              proper contact. F should also be on email again, as her old computer 
              is already at Sutton Courtenay waiting to be installed. So I don't 
              think anyone will actually get to visit Faith in hospital after 
              all this waiting! Some have asked about calling the Burns Unit, 
              but they don't really have facilities for calls for patients, so 
              I think it will have to wait until next week when she'll be back 
              in the world. By November we should be installed in our own new 
              flat, not confirmed, but most likely still in Oxford, and it's more 
              than likely that when she's up to travel, she'll travel around and 
              see as many of you as she can.</p>
            <p>Other big news is that F has her mask now. Unsurprisingly she's 
              not a bit happy about it, but she won't have to wear it 24 hrs a 
              day, so if she's goes out, she might not have it on. It might be 
              part of her life for a full year however.</p>

              Many, many thanks once again for all your emails and pictures - 
              superb red tractor James, I'm not even going to try to compete. 
              Brendan - I'm definitely considering installing myself permanently 
              in the boathouse, probably wrapped in a tartan blanket and wearing 
              some sort of smoking cap. Jim - I'm holding off my entrance into 
              a state of infinite happiness until I can get my trousers on by 
              myself - hope this is alright? And Clare - how much we'd both like 
              to be in a hail-stoned Norway - it sounds as if you're having a 
              great time.</p>

              here - well, I'm now wearing CLOTHES - fetching combination of tracksuit 
              bottoms and one of Alun's mum's polka dot tops. Very chic/schik. 
              Can also get round a bit more. Have been measured for a pressure 
              suit (kind of lycra corset - perhaps I'll end up looking like that 
              sexy alien from Star Trek? There's always hope . . .[and F doesn't 
              like sci-fi? ed.]) which I'll have to wear for A WHOLE YEAR. Am 
              getting my even more attractive plastic mask next week - a pretty 
              appalling prospect, but everyone here raves about the results, so 
              I'll have to grin and bear it. Am going to have to invest in a range 
              of interesting hats. Or perhaps convert to Islam? One of those black, 
              billowing burqa would come in handy. Anyway - once again I must 
              sign off, poor old Alun is going to type all this up. He's drawing 
              a picture of me at the moment, to give you an idea of my present 
              eccentric coiffure!</p>

              seems to make F throw up, which means she needs a nasal feed to 
              make up the calorific intake required!</p>
            <p>On a lighter note, the trusty Cavalier made its last journey yesterday, 
              to the scrap yard. Just after delivering me safely to Selly Oak 
              it started smoking (appropriately enough in the designated smoking 
              area outside the hospital). It's done a fantastic extra 7,000 miles 
              this summer, and I don't even have a photo of it :-( <br>
              As a result Faith now has some important and useful additions to 
              her room, a car CD player, foot pump, battery charger, extra blankets 
              and de-icer. This has cheered her up greatly.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone - I feel a bit overwhelmed after having read Alun's 
              compendious day to day account of parts of my life that I'd almost 
              forgotten (or wasn't awake enough to appreciate). Did I really ask 
              for Fame Academy to be turned off? Shame on me! But yes - I am prepared 
              to admit my ongoing addiction to Sex and the City and almost any 
              crappy interior design or gardening programme going. While I couldn't 
              eat this also extended to cookery shows (I'd start salivating at 
              the mere sight of Ainsley Herriot - yes, it really was that bad 
              . . . )</p>
            <p>Needless to say, I've been evermore overwhelmed by the immense 
              kindness everyone has shown me during this whole trauma - I really 
              don't know how to thank you all enough for your thoughts, prayers, 
              words, and (of course) emails. It's odd, but this has made what 
              is in some ways a terrible experience into one with many, many positives. 
              I'm still a bit shy about visitors - but they're planning to let 
              me out on day release (&agrave; la prison) as soon as I can do more 
              than circle the room with the aid of a physiotherapist and a zimmer 
              frame. So who knows? That long-awaited trip to Alton Towers perhaps?</p>

            <p>Right, must stop now as dinner has arrived, and Alun 
              is distracting me with his raucous laughter at the latest offering 
              from the Simpsons. <br>
              Love to you all, <br>

              mask. She will possibly have to wear one for a few months. This 
              is only to keep pressure on the skin, because the biggest thing 
              with burns scars is that grafts can tend to contract unless pressure 
              is kept on them for quite a while after surgery. This is the reason 
              for both the mask and the 'pressure' garments that F will wear for 
              up to two years from now. We haven't seen the mask, but it's apparently 
              like the one Pam Warren wore after the Paddington disaster - transparent 
              and tight fitting and actually reasonably discreet. </p>

She was going to show it at a private view at the gallery that evening, so Faith stays for that. At the PV everyone else thought the drawing was pretty bad too. There were two parts to the gallery, F in the smaller, less busy part. Realised she was sitting in an airplane seat,looked up and saw that that small bit of the gallery was like part of a plane which was flying to Paris after the PV. F panicked, as she didn't have a passport or any money - so asked if they were going to stop anywhere. The plane did stop, in a field with a chateau. The captain argued with the crew about something, so the plane just sat there all day in the field. Meanwhile some local gypsy children came and stole all the pre-packed meals. Others on the plane noted that this was a great example of the French working class spirit.<br>
		  F at this point was sick and needed a blood transfusion, but the woman who was supposed to be helping her was in fact trying to kill her. She shut F up in a small cubicle and walked around it with a scaffolding pole, which was very scary, and told everyone F was a pathological liar who had killed her sister. Bit forgotten here, but eventually F escaped and got to Paris. The press were waiting and the only person F could think of who could help was Julian [F been on a recent trip to Paris with Julian, ed]. She found some friends of his working in an eco-shop - they were going to print the story and get themselves a news scoop. By the way they also ran an Indian puppet theatre. F agreed to meet Julian so he could drive her back to the UK, but she missed the appointment because she couldn't move. He was extremely cross, but Faith couldn't explain the reason. Three other friends of Julian's had a boat and agreed to take F back to the UK. They had a beautiful trip and at the end were picked up by a navy vessel which had nurses on board. The End!</p>

              just because my hands free set keeps breaking, but because it's 
              soon to be illegal, then I'm at the hospital where mobiles are not

              I have no mobile reception (O2 btw). Thank goodness for modern technology 
              eh? From September, I'll be back to working for myself in Oxford,

              Faith came off sedation at 12 noon, and when I saw her at 3pm she 
              was blinking and occassionally responding to questions with nods 
              and wiggling her feet. She's on ventilation two hours out of every 
              three, so learning again to breathe for herself in the other hour 
              (with the tube still in place). It's bound to be a very weird period 
              emerging from three weeks of unconsciousness, but she definitely 
              nodded her head at the idea of playing her Chill-Out by the KLF 
              when I left! <br>

              All this has happened sooner than expected, and is a really good 
              sign that her condition has improved dramatically. Again, there 
              are the usual warnings that she's still extremely susceptible to 
              infection at this stage, and still has a way to go before she's

              on rotation between two hospitals in Birmingham, so we've hardly 
              spoken to the same one twice). The picture is getting a little bit 
              clearer to us (and probably to them). It seems the intial explosion 
              caused more damage than was at first thought. This led to inflammation 
              in the lungs, and consequent lung damage, pneumothorax (<a href="http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/WSIHW000/9339/23666.html" target="new">*</a>). 
              This means a portion of her left lung has hardened and is not functioning. 
              This is not too damaging by itself in a healthy person, but obviously 
              Faith is in a severely critical state, so it's causing the complications. 
              The infections picked up two weeks ago exacerbated the problem, 
              but are not now the principal cause of concern. Her O2 and CO2 levels 
              continue to fluctuate daily, but all without affecting her badly 
              at the moment - her other organs are functioning fine. However it 
              now seems the oscillator may have made little difference after all 
              (sorry to fans of the oscillator, but to be honest it didn't look 
              very hi-tech!). So the situation remains very serious and we and 
              the doctors can only hope the lung repairs itself soon. Thomas Tallis
